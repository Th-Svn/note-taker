GIVEN a note-taking application

WHEN I open the Note Taker

THEN I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page

WHEN I click on the link to the notes page

THEN I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note’s text

THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page

WHEN I click on the Save icon

THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes

WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column

THEN that note appears in the right-hand column

WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page

THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column

### The project
We want to be able to edit and save notes.
